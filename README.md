  - TCP details: reliability and flow control 
  - TCP congestion control
- Network layer (lecture 10–16)
  - Overview
  - Routers
  - Intra-domain routing 
  - Inter-domain routing

  - Ethernet


## Final Exam Comments

- Most of the questions are about the understanding of concepts.
- This course is relatively easy, as all stuff are in a structured way.
- Take advantage of the exam cheat sheet will help a lot.
  - Some missing part not in my [notes](./Final/ECE4016%20Computer%20Networks%20-%20CP.pdf):
    - SDN
    - TCP: GBN, SR.
  - Really important: TCP's congestion control and flow control.
  - Most shown example questions in lecture can be found in final exam paper.
- P.S. GPT is not allowed in this course, since GPT always knows the answer.
